# Firefox add-on to handle multiple selections on a web page and send with URI to a server

I wrote this for a few of my own projects and I hope you find it useful also. When the Firefox add-on is installed, edit
the add-on settings with the URI of your web service and a user specific auth token generated by your web service
for an authorized user.

Assuming your web service is at http://EXAMPLE.COM, then implement a route and handler for:

        /apiuser?sel=<JSON DATA FOR SELECTIONS>&auth=<AN AUTH TOKEN YOUR SERVICE ACCEPTS>

If your web service responds OK, then the user is notified that all is well. If your service returns a string
starting with "ERROR" then the error message is displayed to the user.

This is the first Firefox extension that I have written. Ideas for improvements and pull requests are welcome!
